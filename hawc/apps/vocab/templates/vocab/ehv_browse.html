<h1>Environmental Health Vocabulary (EHV)</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        Experimental data extracted into HAWC is designed to enable filtering, sorting, and
        visualizations of the findings. To enable the ability to browse and filter at different
        levels, a curated controlled vocabulary of terms can be used to extract content from
        literature. However, numerous external ontologies and thesauri exist in the biological
        domain that can map health-effects and knowledge. Therefore, these controlled vocabularies
        can also be mapped to external entities.

    <div  class="alert alert-info">
        <p>
            We're just getting started; in 2021 we hope to have a much richer experience with linkages to external ontologies. Stay tuned!
