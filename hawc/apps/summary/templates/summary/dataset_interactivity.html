<h1>HAWC Interactivity with Datasets</h1>
<p>Some visuals allow deeper interactivity with HAWC by displaying modals or linking to HAWC content.
This interactivity is also available with uploaded datasets as long as they have the correct column headings.
The following table shows what column headings are needed in a dataset to allow access to the associated interactivity.</p>
<div id="extension-table"></div>
