    Literature workflows define groups of references in a specific state of tagging. References must match all admission criteria and none of the removal criteria to fit in a workflow. Workflows can filter references for various pages in HAWC; like the tagging, conflict resolution, and list views. Linked tiles to some of these workflow-filtered pages can be added to the Literature Review home page for quick access.
