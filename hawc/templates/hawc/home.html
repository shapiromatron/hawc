<p>
  Regulatory agencies around the world conduct assessments to determine
  the potential for chemicals to pose a risk to human health. These
  assessments typically consist of a critical review of available studies,
  identification of adverse health effects from chemicals, and
  characterization of exposure-response relationships and uncertainties
  in the data. HAWC aims to facilitate team collaboration by
  scientists who develop these assessments and enhance transparency of
  the process by providing online access to the data and
  expert decisions used to evaluate the potential human health hazard
  and risk of chemical exposures.

<p>
  HAWC is a modular, content management system designed to store, display,
  and synthesize multiple data sources for the purpose of producing
  human health assessments of chemicals. This online application
  documents the overall workflow of developing an assessment, from
  literature search and systematic review, to data extraction (human
  epidemiology, animal bioassay, and in vitro assay), dose-response
  analysis, and finally evidence synthesis and visualization.
