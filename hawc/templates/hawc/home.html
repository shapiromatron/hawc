        Regulatory agencies around the world conduct assessments to determine
        the potential for chemicals to pose a risk to human health. These
        assessments typically consist of a critical review of available studies,
        identification of adverse health effects from chemicals, and
        characterization of exposure-response relationships and uncertainties
        in the data. HAWC aims to facilitate team collaboration by
        scientists who develop these assessments and enhance transparency of
        the process by providing online access to the data and
        expert decisions used to evaluate the potential human health hazard
        and risk of chemical exposures.

        HAWC is a modular, content management system designed to store, display,
        and synthesize multiple data sources for the purpose of producing
        human health assessments of chemicals. This online application
        documents the overall workflow of developing an assessment, from
        literature search and systematic review, to data extraction (human
        epidemiology, animal bioassay, and in vitro assay), dose-response
        analysis, and finally evidence synthesis and visualization.
