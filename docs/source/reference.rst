Statistical methods used
========================

All statistical methods are documented in the source code, which is publicly available. `<https://github.com/shapiromatron/hawc>`_.  If you're interested in locating a particular method and have troubles navigating the source code, please contact us and we can help.

Bioassay:
---------

- For single dose-response confidence intervals displayed on the dose-response plot:
   - For continuous data, 95% confidence intervals are calculated using a two-tailed t-test (eg., `<https://hawcproject.org/ani/endpoint/1/>`_)
   - For dichotomous data, intervals are calculated using the inverse standard normal cumulative distribution function evaluated at :math:`1-\alpha/2`, using a two-sided 95% confidence interval (eg., `<https://hawcproject.org/ani/endpoint/30/>`_)

- For calculating percent control relative to the control response (in data-pivot, eg., `<https://hawcproject.org/summary/data-pivot/assessment/1/feature-example-percent-difference/>`_):
    - 95% confidence intervals are calculated using a Fisher Information Matrix, assuming independent normal distributions
    - This statistic assumes that first dose-group is control, and all other dose-groups are compared to control
    - Calculation of confidence intervals requires the following:
        - The endpoint dataset must provide variance measures (i.e. standard deviation or standard error)
        - The control mean value must not be equal to zero (cannot divide by zero)
        - The n for each dose-group must be provided, including control
    - A detailed description of the method `is available <ci_description.html>`__

In-vitro:
---------

- For single dose-response confidence intervals displayed on the dose-response plot:
   - same as continuous methods for bioassay data, as described above

- For calculating percent control relative to the control response (in data-pivot):
    - same as methods for bioassay data, as described above

Epidemiology:
-------------

- For confidence intervals on epidemiology result-datasets
    - If 95% confidence intervals are entered, they are presented (eg., `<https://hawcproject.org/epi/result/98/>`_)
    - If 95% confidence intervals are not entered, and the response is a normal distribution with a SD or SE:
        - 95% confidence intervals are calculated using a two-tailed t-test (eg., `<https://hawcproject.org/epi/result/1445/>`_)

- For calculating percent control relative to the control response (in data-pivot):
    - same as methods for bioassay data, as described above
    - The control group is determined by the following rules:
        - If 0 groups are marked control (using comparison-set groups), the first group will be chosen as control
        - If 1 groups is marked control (using comparison-set groups), the first group will be chosen as control
        - If â‰¥ 2 groups are marked control (using comparison-set groups), a random control group will be chosen for control for all calculations

Project management settings
===========================

The project-management module in is designed to allow users to track the progress for data extraction and completion in HAWC. There are four tasks for each study:

1. **Study preparation**: content which should be extracted is clarified and saved to the ``Study`` instance
2. **Data extraction**: data extracted from paper into HAWC. This can be animal bioassay, epidemiological, epidemiological meta-analyses, or in-vitro data.
3. **QA/QC**: data extracted has been QA/QC.
4. **Risk of Bias:** Risk of bias has been completed.

With each tasks, there are four possible statuses:

1. **Not started**
2. **Started**
3. **Completed**
4. **Abandoned**

Tasks can be assigned to users, and due-dates can also be added (optionally). The status can be manually changed for each task by users using the management dashboard.

In addition, "signals" are automatically fired in order to help users keep track of progress, which automatically change the status of tasks for a particular ``Study``. The following signals are implemented:

- When a ``Study`` is created...
    - If the study preparation task is currently "not started", the task is assigned to the user who created the study, and it is marked "started".
- When data is extracted into a ``Study`` (i.e. animal bioassy ``Experiment``, an epidemiology ``Study population``, and epidemiology meta-analysis ``Study Protocol``, or an *in vitro* ``Experiment``)...
    - If the study preparation task is currently "started", the task is marked "complete"
    - If the data extraction task is currently "not started", the task is assigned to the user who added the data, and it is marked "started".
- When ``Risk of Bias`` is modified...
    - If the risk of bias task is currently "not started", the task is assigned to the user who modified the Risk of Bias, and it is marked "started".
- When a final ``Risk of Bias`` is completed (which may include conflict resolution)...
    - If the risk of bias task is currently "started", the task is marked "complete"

Unfortunately, we cannot track everything with the automated signals. Therefore, the following task-operations do not have any "signals" associated with them, and must always be manually performed by a user:

- Marking the Data extraction task as "complete" OR "abandoned"
- Marking the QA/QC task as "started"
- Marking the QA/QC task as "completed" OR "abandoned"

.. note::
    Users can always manually modify task status as needed; the signals are designed to help keep track of the tasks where possible automatically in case a user may forget to do so.
