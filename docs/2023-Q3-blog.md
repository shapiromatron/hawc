### Data Pivot visualization improvements
#### Arrows when confidence intervals extend beyond plot domain
If an x-axis domain is restricted to be less than the entire domain, arrows are shown. Hovering over the bar will show upper and lower values.

#### Configure plot background colors and gridlines
Added more flexibility to show/hide background color, gridlines, and text grid. The default layout is unchanged.

#### `x-axis` customization
Previously, when setting an x-axis range, we'd automatically assume that you'd want to show around 10 ticks (numbers on the x-axis), but would be flexible to show more or less depending on the range. Now, if you'd like more control, you can set the domain to be forced, and set the number of ticks. This will allow full control of setting the x-axis bounds and layout.
