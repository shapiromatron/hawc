# Clients and APIs

The development team maintains a number of clients and APIs that are used for development and for some user interfaces for the application. The same rules for authentication and authorization are in place to access data from HAWC assessments programmatically using the API or clients.  Access for assessments can only be modified using the HAWC website; they cannot be changed via the client or API at this time.

## Python HAWC client

A [HAWC client](https://pypi.org/project/hawc-client/) has been developed and is the recommended approach to programmatically add or fetch content
from a HAWC instance. To install the client (requires Python â‰¥ 3.9):

```bash
python -m pip install -U hawc-client
```

Using a notebook or python shell:

```python
from getpass import getpass
from hawc_client import HawcClient

client = HawcClient("https://hawcproject.org")

# Authentication is deployment specific. If the hawc deployment stores and manages user
# accounts directly, then you can login via the HAWC API to authenticate:
client.authenticate(email="me@me.com", password=getpass())

# For other deployments which use external authentication, a user should login via the browser
# as a normal user, and then view the token on their user profile:
client.set_authentication_token(token=getpass())

# get all references for an assessment
client.lit.references(assessment_id=123)

```

There are many more commands available in the HAWC client that aren't documented here. It is recommended to use an interactive terminal session using a jupyter notebook to browse the available methods and their docstrings for more details.

### Changelog

#### [2022-07](https://pypi.org/project/hawc-client/2022.7/) (July 2022)

* Added ``client.study.studies`` to return dataframe of studies for an assessment
* Added new parameter, ``invert``, to the ``client.animal.endpoints``
    * When invert is False (default), returns a list of endpoints with parent data nested
    * When invert is True, returns a list of studies, with child data nested
* Added ``client.riskofbias.metrics`` to return a dataframe of metrics for an assessment
* Added ``client.riskofbias.reviews`` to return a list of reviews for an assessment

### Distributing HAWC clients

The Python HAWC client can be packaged for easy distribution.

```bash
# install dependencies
pip install twine wheel

# change to client path
cd client

# build packages; these can be distributed directly
make build

# or can be uploaded to pypi
make upload-testpypi
make upload-pypi
```

## R HAWC client

An R client is also available. To install and use:

```R
devtools::install_github('shapiromatron/hawc', subdir='client/r/rhawc')
library(rhawc)

client <- HawcClient("https://hawcproject.org")
client$authenticate("me@me.com", getPass::getPass())

# get all references for an assessment
client$lit_references(assessment_id=123)
```

Please note that the Python client is considered the reference implementation for a HAWC client and will include the latest features; the R client may be a little behind. A high-level notebook we use for testing is available to see how the R client works: [R tutorial](https://github.com/shapiromatron/hawc/blob/master/scripts/client/r-client.ipynb). For more detailed trainings, see the Python notebook tutorials above.

## API access

Authenticated users can access HAWC REST APIs; below is an example script for use:

```python
import requests

session = requests.Session()
login = requests.post(
    "https://hawcproject.org/user/api/token-auth/",
    json={"username": "me@me.com", "password": "keep-it-hidden"}
)

if login.status_code == 200:
    session.headers.update(Authorization=f"Token {login.json()['token']}")
else:
    raise EnvironmentError("Authentication failed")

session.get('https://hawcproject.org/ani/api/endpoint/?assessment_id=123').json()
```
