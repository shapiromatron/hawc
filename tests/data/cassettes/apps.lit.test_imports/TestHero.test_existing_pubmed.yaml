        health risks associated with ozone depletion will principally be those due
        to increased ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation in the environment, i.e., increased
        damage to the eyes, the immune system, and the skin. Some new risks may also
        be introduced with the increased use of alternatives to the ozone-depleting
        substances (ODSs). Quantitative risk estimates are available for some of the
        UV-B-associated effects, e.g., cataract and skin cancer; however, the data
        are insufficient to develop similar estimates for effects such as immunosuppression
        and the toxicity of alternatives. Ocular damage from UV exposures includes
        effects on the cornea, lens, iris, and associated epithelial and conjunctival
        tissues. The most common acute ocular effect of environmental ultraviolet
        radiation (UVR) is photokeratitis. Also known as snowblindness in skiers,
        this condition also occurs in other outdoor recreationists. Chronic eye conditions
        likely to increase with ozone depletion include cataract, squamous cell carcinoma,
        ocular melanoma, and a variety of corneal/conjunctival effects, e.g., pterygium
        and pinguecula. Suppression of local (at the site of UV exposure) and systemic
        (at a distant, unexposed site) immune responses to a variety of antigens has
        been demonstrated in both humans and animals exposed to UV-B. In experiments
        with animals these effects have been shown to worsen the course/outcome of
        some infectious diseases and cancers. There is reasonably good evidence that
        such immunosuppression plays a role in human carcinogenesis; however, the
        implications of such immunosuppression for human infectious diseases are still
        unknown. In light-skinned populations, exposure to solar UVR appears to be
        the most important environmental risk factor for basal and squamous cell carcinomas
        and cutaneous melanoma. Originally it was believed that total accumulated
        exposure to UVR was the most important environmental factor in determining
        risk for these tumors. Recent information now suggests that only squamous
        cell carcinoma risk is related to total exposure. In the cases of both basal
        cell carcinoma and melanoma, new information suggests that increases in risk
        are tied to early exposures (before about age 15), particularly those leading
        to severe sunburns. Testing of a number of the chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) alternatives
        indicates that most of these chemicals have low acute toxicity, and low to
        moderate chronic toxicity. Some chemicals that were originally proposed as
        alternatives have been dropped from consideration because these tests raised
        concerns about toxicity and/or manufacturing difficulties. In one instance,
        high accidental occupational exposure was associated with liver damage, underlining
        the need for care in the use of these substitutes. Recent quantitative risk
        estimates have been developed for cataract, melanoma, and all skin cancers
        combined. These estimates indicate that under the Montreal Adjustments, cataract
        and skin-cancer incidence will peak mid-century at additional incidences of
        just under 3 per 100,000 and about 7 per 100,000, respectively.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList
