        effects of high O3 (200 nl 1-1  during the light period) and high CO2 (650
        \ l-1CO2, 24 h a day) alone and in combination were studied on 45-day-old
        sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) seedlings for 61 days in growth chambers.
        After 2 months of treatment under the environmental conditions of the experiment,
        sugar maple seedlings did not show a marked response to the elevated CO2 treatment:
        the effect of high CO2 on biomass was only detected in the leaves which developed
        during the treatment, and assimilation rate was not increased. Under high
        O3 at ambient CO2, assimilation rate at days 41 and 55 and Rubisco content
        at day 61 decreased in the first pair of leaves; total biomass was reduced
        by 43%. In these seedlings large increases (more than 2-fold) in glucose 6-phosphate
        dehydrogenase (G6PDH, EC 1.1.1.49) activity and in anaplerotic CO2 fixation
        by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC, EC 4.1.1.31) were observed, suggesting
        that an enhanced reducing power and carbon skeleton production was needed
        for detoxification and repair of oxidative damage. Under high O3 at elevated
        CO2, a stimulation of net CO2 assimilation was observed after 41 days but
        was no longer observed at day 55. However, at day 61, the total biomass was
        only reduced by 21% and stimulation of G6PDH and PEPC was less pronounced
        than under high O3 at ambient CO2. This suggests that high CO2 concentration
        protects, to some extent, against O3 by providing additional carbon and energy
        through increased net assimilation.\",\"url\":\"https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/50086\",\"hasPDF\":true,\"YEAR\":2003,\"allAuthors\":[\"Gaucher,

        \ Elevated CO2 concentrations expected in the 21st century can stimulate plant
        growth and yield, whereas tropospheric 03 suppresses plant growth and yield
        in many areas of the world. Recent experiments showed that elevated CO2 often
        protects plants from 03 stress, but this has not been tested for many important
        crop species including snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). The objective of
        this study was to determine if elevated CO2 protects snap bean from 03 stress.
        An 03-tolerant cultivar (Tenderette) and an 03-sensitive selection (S156)were
        exposed from shortly after emergence to maturity to mixtures of CO2 and 03
        in open-top field chambers. The two CO2 treatments were ambient and ambient
        with CO2 added for 24 h d1 resulting in seasonal 12 h d' (0800-2000 h EST)
        mean concentrations of 366 and697 p~L L', respectively. The two 03 treatments
        were charcoal-filtered air and nonfiltered air with 03 added for 12 h d1 to
        achieve seasonal12 h d' (0800-2000 h EST) mean concentrations of 23 and 72
        nLL1, respectively. Elevated CO2 significantly stimulated growth and pod weight
        of Tenderette and S156, whereas elevated 03 significantly suppressed growth
        and pod weight of S156 but not of Tenderette. The suppressive effect of elevated
        03 on pod dry weight of 5156was approximately 75% at ambient CO2 and approximately
        60% at elevated CO2 (harvests combined). This amount of protection from03
        stress afforded by elevated CO2 was much less than reported for other crop
        species. Extreme sensitivity to 03 may be the reason elevated CO2 failed to
        significantly protect S156 from 03 stress.\",\"url\":\"https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/50096\",\"hasPDF\":true,\"YEAR\":2002,\"allAuthors\":[\"Heagle,

        \ Effects of ozone (O3) stress of potato, Solanum tuberosum L., on fecundity,
        larval growth and survival of Colorado potato beetles, Leptinotarsa decemlirieata
        (Say), were measured in greenhouse and field experiments. Chronic O3 exposure
        caused moderate to severe foliar injury on an O3-sensitive cultivar ('Red
        Norland') but caused only minor injury an O3-resistant cultivar ('Superior').
        Foliar injury caused by O3 was greater on old than on young leaves but feeding
        by adult beetles was greater on young leaves in all experiments. Foliar analyses
        of the five uppermost leaves(nodes 1-5) showed higher carbon (C) and higher
        nitrogen (N) concentration in Superior than in Norland. There were no significant
        O3 effects on C or N and no cultivar X O3 interactions. Egg production by
        newly emerged adult beetles feeding on plants exposed to high O3 levels was
        not significantly different from egg production on plants exposed to low O3
        levels, regardless of cultivar O3 sensitivity. Feeding and energy conversion
        efficiency of neonates and survival of larvae to the adult stage were not
        significantly affected by the O3 treatment. Although present levels of tropospheric
        O3 are high enough to significantly affect yield of sensitive potato cultivars,
        our results indicate no significant effect of ambient O3 concentrations on

        for Air Quality Analysis at Caltech. #Atmospheric ultrafine particles (diameter
        < 0.1 \\\"mu\\\"m) are under study by inhalation toxicoiogists to determine
        whether they pose a threat to public health, yet, little is known about the
        chemical composition of ultrafine particles in the atmosphere of cities. In
        the present work, the number concentration, size distribution, and chemical
        composition of atmospheric ultrafine particles is determined under wintertime
        conditions in Pasadena, CA, near Los Angeles. These experiments are conducted
        using a scanning differential mobility analyzer, laser optical counter, and
        two micro-orifice impactors. Samples are analyzed to create a material balance
        on the chemical composition of the ultrafine particles. The number concentration
        of ultrafine particles in the size range 0.017 < dp < 0.1 \\\"mu\\\"m, analyzed
        over 24-h periods, is found to be consistently in the range 1.3 x 10(4) +/-
        8.9 x 10(3) particles cm-3 air. Ultrafine particle mass concentrations are
        in the range 0.80-1.58 \\\"mu\\\"g m-3. Organic compounds are the largest
        contributors to the ultrafine particle mass concentration. A small amount
        of sulfate is present in these particles, at concentrations too low to tell
        whether it exists as unneutralized sulfuric acid.  Iron is the most prominent
        transition metal found in the ultrafine particles. These data may assist the
        health effects research community in constructing realistic animal or human
        exposure studies involving ultrafine particles.\",\"url\":\"https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/50084\",\"hasPDF\":true,\"YEAR\":1998,\"allAuthors\":[\"Hughes,

        Science Foundation.#Humidity effects on the gas/particle partitioning of the
        different types of semivolatile organic compounds (SOCs) in the organic layer
        of wood soot, diesel soot, and secondary aerosols were studied in outdoor
        environmental chambers. Experimental partitioning coefficients, Kp, of different
        SOCs were measured using outdoor Teflon film chambers and compared to theoretical
        Kp values calculated with the aid of activity coefficients and vapor pressures.
        A thermodynamic model based on group contribution methods was used to estimate
        SOC activity coefficients in the liquid organic layer of different atmospheric
        particles. The equilibrated water content in the organic phase of chemically
        different particles was estimated from the activity coefficient of water in
        the particle's organic liquid and the ambient relative humidity (RH). It was
        found that predicted SOC activity coefficients (iy00Om) for diesel soot particles
        were not a strong function of RH. There was, however, a dramatic change in
        iy00Om on wood soot particles for hydrophobic compounds such as alkanes and
        polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with changing RH. For polar SOCs, such as
        n-alkanoic acids and substituted phenols on wood soot particles, 1y00Om did
        not change with increasing RH. Similar behavior to wood soot particles was
        observed for 1y00Om on secondary aerosols from the reaction of \\\"alpha\\\"-pinene
        with 03. It was concluded that humidity effect on partitioning was most significant
        for hydrophobic compounds in polar aerosols.\",\"url\":\"https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/50043\",\"hasPDF\":true,\"YEAR\":1998,\"allAuthors\":[\"Jang,

        cultivars of tobacco with contrasting sensitivity to ozone have similar photosynthesis
        at low light intensity, but at high light, photosynthesis of the sensitive
        cultivar Bel-W3 was lower than that of the resistant cultivar Havana. In contrast,
        the electron transport rate at photosynthesis saturated light intensity was
        higher in Bel-W3 than in Havana. This excess may require efficient mechanisms
        to dissipate energy and oxygen radicals. We found that the non-radiative dissipation
        was lower in Bel-W3 than in Havana and that the conversion between violaxanthin
        and antheraxanthin + zeaxanthin was not complete in the ozone sensitive cultivar.
        Violaxanthin may have been partly converted in ABA. The high content of ABA
        may have caused stomatal closure and explain why photosynthesis at high light
        was reduced in Bel-W3 in comparison to Havana. \u2580-Carotene content was
        also lower in Bel-W3 than in Havana. A low \u2580-carotene content coupled

        \  Over 1500 fixed-site ozone monitors are described in the site inventory
        maintained by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USE PA)1      Ozone
        concentrations measured by these monitors are routinely used to determine
        the attainment status of defined urban areas with respect to the National
        Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone.      In applications of the
        NAAQS Exposure Model for ozone (pNEM/O3)2    and similar computer-based models,
        researchers frequently estimate outdoor (ambient) ozone concentrations as
        a function of ozone data obtained from selected monitors.  Both uses of fixed-site
        monitoring data are based on the implicit assumption that the data provide
        an unbiased estimate of the ozone concentrations of air respired by people
        at outdoor locations near the monitor.  This assumption may not be justified.

        the upper bound for the breathing zone of a typical pedestrian. To evaluate
        the effect of probe height on measured ozone concentration. IT Air Quality
        Services(ITAQS) performed a series of vertical measurements of ozone concentration
        in the lower 80 meters of the surface boundary layer.  The measurements were
        made during August 1995 at an inoperative radio tower located in Cincinnati,
        Ohio.  This report describes the procedures used in the study, summarizes
        the collected data, and provides an evaluation of the results.\",\"url\":\"https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/50066\",\"hasPDF\":true,\"YEAR\":1996,\"allAuthors\":[\"Wisbith,

        four different concentrations (26, 77, 201 and 386 ppm). Styrene levels were
        measured in arterialized capillary blood during and after exposure by head-space
        gas chromatography, and the levels of mandelic acid in urine were analysed
        by high-performance liquid chromatography. Non-linear relationships between
        the level of exposure to styrene and the concentration of styrene in arterial
        blood and 0-5 h cumulative excretion of mandelic acid indicated metabolic
        saturation. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was used to estimate
        the maximum metabolic rate (Vmax) of styrene from data on blood styrene. According
        to the model, the Vmax is 2.9 mmol/h, and metabolic saturation occurs at concentrations
        of 100-200 ppm styrene, depending on the level of physical activity. To our
        knowledge, this is the first time that dose-dependent kinetics of styrene
        has been shown in humans.\",\"url\":\"https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/50057\",\"hasPDF\":true,\"isbn\":9789283221272,\"YEAR\":1993,\"allAuthors\":[\"L\xF6f,

        have studied the erythrocytes from 24 workers occupationally exposed to inorganic
        lead, one asymptomatic lead worker showing exceptionally high exposure, and
        eight control subjects (blood lead 300-750, 1800, and < 100 micrograms/L,
        respectively). High performance protein chromatography, electrophoresis, and
        trace metal analysis have identified a low M.Wt., copper, and zinc-containing
        protein in all cases. This protein (designated protein M) bound lead on in
        vitro incubation with buffered lead nitrate. Purified samples of protein M
        were found to show characteristics consistent with metallothionein (M.Wt.
        approximately 6500, low pI, and greater UV absorbance at 254 nm). Amino acid
        analysis found a composition of 33% cysteine but no aromatic amino acids.
        The highly exposed subject showed endogenous lead binding to protein M, which
        on further purification by ion exchange was found to be associated with one
        particular constituent (protein M5). Protein M5 was present in much lower
        quantities in control subjects. These findings suggest the existence of a
        metallothionein-like protein in erythrocytes which binds lead, sequestering

        neurobehavioral screening battery consisting of a functional observational
        battery (FOB) and an automated measure of motor activity is the subject of
        an international collaborative study. Eight laboratories (four in Europe,
        four in the U.S.) are participating in this study, which is sponsored by the
        International Programme on Chemical Safety within the World Health Organization.
        Representatives from each laboratory received training on testing procedures
        and the study protocol during a 2-day workshop. Each laboratory then conducted
        studies using positive control chemicals to demonstrate their proficiency
        with the techniques. For motor activity studies, each laboratory had to show
        acute increases and decreases in activity produced by triadimefon and chlorpromazine,
        respectively. Using the FOB, each laboratory had to detect certain neurological
        syndromes: tremorigenic activity of a single dose of p,p'-DDT, cholinergic
        signs with parathion, and neuromuscular deficits with short-term (1-2 weeks)
        repeated administration of acrylamide. In the formal studies, the effects
        of seven chemicals are currently being determined following both acute and
        4-week exposures. The chemicals include triethyl tin, acrylamide, parathion,
        p,p'-DDT, toluene, lead acetate, and N,N'-methylene bisacrylamide. All chemicals
        were provided to the laboratories from a single supplier. Each laboratory
        is conducting the studies under their standard conditions, using their own
        strain of rat and testing equipment. Each laboratory also determines a maximum-tolerated
        dose for each compound as well as the time of peak effect following acute
        exposure. A simple algorithm is then used to select doses for the formal acute
        and repeated-exposure experiments. These studies will provide information
        regarding the reliability and robustness of neurobehavioral screening methods
        over a wide range of laboratory conditions.\",\"url\":\"https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/50065\",\"hasPDF\":true,\"YEAR\":1992,\"allAuthors\":[\"Moser,

        MEDLINE: Data on Cd sources in food are presented and the effects are discussed
        of the raised environmental level of Cd concentration in some foods. Information
        is also presented on normal dietary intakes of this element and how these
        intakes may be increased by environmental pollution or atypical dietary habits.
        With reference to the exposure risk, the FAO/WHO has established for adults
        a Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI) limit of 7 micrograms/kg B.W..
        Therefore the evaluation of dietary Cd intake has become very important. The
        purpose of this work is the estimation of dietary intakes of Cd using data
        on the composition of an average Italian diet. Complete meals from a factory
        canteen were analyzed and calculations of weekly intake of Cd carried out.
        Mean dietary intake was 222 micrograms per week (range 137-326 micrograms
        per week) or 32 micrograms per day (range 19-46 micrograms per day), with
        the median intake being 198 micrograms per week or 28 micrograms per day.
        Analyses were performed by means of Zeeman Electrothermal Atomization Atomic
        Absorption Spectrometry (ETA-AAS). The results obtained, related to the average
        and representative food consumption of Italian people, show that the weekly

        OBJECTIVE: </strong>The aim was to investigate whether occupational exposure

        study, nested within the wives of men biologically monitored for inorganic
        lead. Information on pregnancy outcome was obtained from medical registers.<br
        /><br /><strong>SUBJECTS: </strong>Cases were defined as wives with malformed

        This approach is not a permanent solution; moreover, off-site shipment and
        disposal of contaminated soil involves high expense, liability, and appropriate
        regulatory approval. Recently, a number of other techniques have been investigated

        to extract lead from contaminated soils. Lead concentrations in the soils
        ranged from 500 to 10,000 mg/kg. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and

        </strong>To present a case of lead poisoning following ingestion of Indian
        herbal medicine.<br /><br /><strong>CLINICAL FEATURES: </strong>A 37-year-old
        man presented with a history of abdominal pain, anorexia and malaise. He had
        recently returned from a trip to India where he had been taking two different
        herbal tonics. Investigation revealed low-grade hepatitis and normocytic anaemia
        with prominent basophilic stippling. The blood lead concentration was high,
        and analysis of the herbal tablets revealed a very high lead content.<br /><br
        /><strong>INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: </strong>The patient required narcotic
        analgesia for abdominal pain and was treated with chelation therapy with calcium
        ethylenediaminetetra-acetate (calcium EDTA) for five days which resulted in
        a high urinary excretion of lead and resolution of his symptoms over a period
        of several days.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>Lead poisoning in
        Australia is usually the result of chronic industrial exposure, but practitioners
        should be aware of the possibility of poisoning from other domestic sources
        such as unglazed pottery, cosmetics and herbal remedies, especially those
        from Asia and India, in which lead may be present in high concentration. Patients
        from Asia who present with unexplained anaemia or abdominal symptoms should

        Mortality studies of lead workers have shown excesses of nonmalignant renal
        disease and cerebrovascular disease. Animal studies and one human study have
        shown excess kidney cancer. We have updated a mortality study of male lead
        smelter workers (n = 1990). \\nMETHODS: An analysis was conducted using standard
        life table techniques. The updated analysis added 11 years of follow-up and
        363 new deaths. \\nRESULTS: The original study had found elevated but nonsignificant
        risks for kidney cancer, stroke, and nonmalignant renal disease, probably
        attributable to lead exposure. Deaths from accidents and nonmalignant respiratory
        disease were significantly elevated, but probably not as a result of lead
        exposure. In the updated study, no new deaths from nonmalignant renal disease
        occurred (9 observed, standardized mortality ratio = 1.21). Three more deaths
        from kidney cancer were observed, yielding a standardized mortality ratio
        of 1.93 (9 observed, 95% CI = 0.88, 3.67), which increased for those who had
        worked in areas with the highest lead exposure (8 observed, standardized mortality
        ratio = 2.39, 95% CI = 1.03, 4.71). Cerebrovascular disease remained elevated
        for those with more than 20 years of exposure (26 observed, standardized mortality
        ratio = 1.41, 95% CI = 0.92, 2.07). \\nCONCLUSIONS: This cohort with high
        lead exposure showed a diminishing excess of death from nonmalignant renal
        disease, a continued excess from kidney cancer, and an excess of cerebrovascular
        disease only in those with longest exposure to lead. \",\"url\":\"https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/50003\",\"hasPDF\":true,\"YEAR\":1992,\"allAuthors\":[\"Steenland,

        1990 Clean Air Act Amendments include specific provisions to study significant
        sources of atmospheric deposition of toxic substances and their impacts on
        the health and welfare of the Great Lakes and other major water bodies. The
        act also requires an assessment of the atmospheric loadings to the Great Lakes
        and other major water bodies. However, because of cost and technological limitations,
        spatially-integrated atmospheric deposition to a body of water can not be
        directly determined. Until recently, the total annual atmospheric deposition
        was estimated from the product of (1) spatially-limited, land-based, rural
        air concentrations, (2) constant theoretical or empirical atmospheric removal
        rates, and (3) the surface area of the water body. Although it is expedient,
        this approach, with its inherent assumptions, has several serious drawbacks
        that cast doubts on the spatially-integrated atmospheric loadings. Comprehensive
        atmospheric deposition models based on future enhanced versions of currently-available
        regional air pollution models offer a more accurate alternative to this traditional
        approach. However, since a better understanding of the emission rates and
        atmospheric processes governing airborne toxic deposition is a prerequisite
        for the enhanced model versions, these comprehensive models will not be operational
        within the next several years. In the interim, the Regional Lagrangian Model
        of Air Pollution (RELMAP), a simple atmospheric deposition model, was applied
        to quantify the expected range of annual deposition amounts of toxic trace
        metals to Lake Michigan. These metals are arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium
        (Cr), lead (Pb), and nickel (Ni).\",\"url\":\"https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/50015\",\"hasPDF\":true,\"YEAR\":1992,\"allAuthors\":[\"Clark,

        investigated the effect of zinc on cadmium cytotoxicity in vascular endothelial
        cells in a culture system. The cytotoxicity was evaluated by [H-3]adenine
        release assay. Cadmium at 2 muM concentration and above significantly increased
        the [H-3]adenine release, but zinc at 80 muM and below did not induce such
        a response after a 24-h incubation. Metallothionein was induced by cadmium
        at 0.1 muM and above but not by zinc at 300 muM and below; however, zinc at
        10 muM and above significantly decreased cadmium- (2 and 5 muM) induced cytotoxicity.
        Zinc protection against cadmium cytotoxicity was also observed in the presence
        of 1 muM cycloheximide. Zinc caused significantly less accumulation of cadmium
        in the cell layer accompanied with a significant accumulation of zinc. The
        distribution (%) of cadmium in the particulate fraction of the cells was significantly
        decreased by zinc. In contrast, cadmium in the cytosol fraction was increased
        in the cells treated with both cadmium and zinc. Gel filtration chromatography
        of the cytosol showed that cadmium was capable of being bound to high-molecular-weight
        proteins and metallothionein. The metallothionein-bound cadmium was not increased
        by zinc; however, the relative distribution of cadmium in the high-molecular-weight
        fraction in the cytosol was decreased in cadmium plus zinc-treated cells.
        From these results, it was suggested that the mechanism by which zinc protects
        endothelial cells from cadmium cytotoxicity was decreased accumulation of
        cadmium in the particulate fraction and in the high-molecular-weight fraction
        in the cytosol of the cells. This alteration is postulated to be caused by
        both zinc-induced decrease in the intracellular cadmium accumulation and the
        sequestration of cadmium by cadmium-induced metallothionein.\",\"url\":\"https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/50068\",\"hasPDF\":false,\"YEAR\":1992,\"allAuthors\":[\"Kaji,

        with the introduction of tetraethyllead (TEL) as an antiknock agent in gasoline
        in 1923, consumption of Pb alkyls in the U.S. peaked in 1969. Although only
        Pb-free gasoline may now be used as an automobile fuel in the U.S., leaded
        gasoline is still used as both an aviation and automobile fuel in many countries
        of the world. Over the past 20 years, there has been increased concern about
        possible contamination of soil and groundwater due to use of leaded gasoline
        and the improper disposal of leaded gasoline sludge. Disposal of lead-containing
        fuel sludge in unlined pits was a common practice for many years. In order
        to assess the potential for Pb alkyl contamination in the environment, this
        review was undertaken with emphasis on the following areas: (1) abiotic and
        biotic decomposition of Pb alkyl compounds; (2) sorption, mobility, and transport
        of Pb alkyl compounds in soil-water systems; (3) toxicity of Pb alkyl compounds;

        case-control study was conducted to assess the effect of occupational exposures
        on the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Interviews were conducted with 303
        persons with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma newly diagnosed from January 1, 1980,
        to May 31, 1982, among residents of the Boston, MA, metropolitan area and
        303 age and gender matched controls. The study found an increased risk of
        disease among persons employed in the agriculture, forestry, and fishing industry
        [relative risk (RR) = 3.0]; the construction industry [RR = 2.1]; and the
        leather industry [RR = 2.1]. The particular job groupings at increased risk
        were plant farmers and gardeners (RR unbounded); painters and plasterers (RR
        = 6.0); and carpenters, brick and stone masons, plumbers, and roofers (RR
        = 12.0). Although other exposures may have led to these increased risks, the
        findings in this study are consistent with an increased risk of non-Hodgkin's
        lymphoma for workers who may be exposed to chlorophenols or phenoxyacetic
        acids. \\r\\n\",\"url\":\"https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/50014\",\"hasPDF\":true,\"YEAR\":1992,\"allAuthors\":[\"Scherr,

        use of metabolic patterns as a basis for the interpretation of toxic effects
        of metal compounds was reviewed.  Most metals were transformed in mammalian
        tissues by reduction/oxidation, conjugation, or alkylation/dealkylation processes.
        \ It occurred in liver and other organs as well as in the gut lumen in which
        case intestinal microflora were involved.  Studies with mercurials showed
        that marked metabolic differences existed between organic (alkyl, aryl, and
        alkoxyalkyl) and inorganic compounds.  The lower toxicity of the last two
        types was due to their rapid conversion to inorganic mercury (7439976) which
        was mediated by a cytosolic enzyme in the liver.  The reduction of hexavalent
        chromium (7440473) to the trivalent form by both rat liver preparations and
        human erythrocyte lysate through the microsomal system was discussed.  The
        involvement of cytochrome-P450 dependent monoxygenases in the conversion of
        tin (7440315) and lead (7439921) compounds was addressed.  The biotransformation
        of arsenic (7440382) was strikingly different between species.  The metabolism
        of inorganic and certain organic selenium (7782492) compounds in mammals was
        based on common pathways.  Theoretically, the biotransformation of metal could
        alter toxicity or kinetics, or both.  Conjugation with glutathione could activate
        or reduce carcinogenic potential.  Examples of pollutant metals, their metabolism
        and associated toxic effects included the demethylation of methyl-mercury
        (22967926) and neurotoxicity, the immunotoxicity of tributyltin (688733) and
        its neurotoxic effects, the limited biochemical reduction of pentavalent vanadium
        (7440622) to the tetravalent form, and the unreduced vanadate causing toxicity,
        and the reduction of pentavalent arsenic to the trivalent carcinogenic form.
        \ The authors conclude that a better knowledge of metal biotransformation
        can lead to significant advances in interpreting toxicological changes.\",\"url\":\"https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/50067\",\"hasPDF\":true,\"YEAR\":1992,\"allAuthors\":[\"Manzo,

        of heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Zn and Cu) were determined in five species of earthworms,
        representing different ecophysiological groups, sampled from soils associated
        with an abandoned Pb and Zn mine site. Surface soil-dwelling species (Aporrectodea
        caliginosa and Allolobophora chlorotica) accumulated significantly greater
        concentrations of Cd than deep-burrowing (Lumbricus terrestris and Aporrectodea
        longa) or litter-dwelling (L. rubellus) species. Aporrectodea caliginosa generally
        accumulated greater concentrations of Pb than other species. The greatest
        concentrations of Zn were generally found in the deep-burrowing species, whilst
        lowest concentrations were found in Allolobophora chlorotica. No consistent
        inter-species pattern was evident for Cu. The composition (metal and organic
        carbon) of the ingesta of earthworms was different to that of the soil. Concentrations
        of Cd in the ingesta of Aporrectodea caliginosa were significantly greater
        than in the ingesta of Aporrectodea longa and L. terrestris; concentrations
        of Pb in the ingesta of Aporrectodea caliginosa and Aporrectodea longa were
        greater than for L. terrestris. The metal concentrations in the faeces were
        similar for all species. A significant correlation exists between ingesta
        and tissue Cd concentrations, but was not evident for Pb or Zn. This suggests
        that ingested total Cd concentration is a primary factor in determining tissue
        Cd concentrations of earthworms. For the other metals other interactive factors
        appear to markedly influence accumulated tissue metal concentrations.\",\"url\":\"https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/50090\",\"hasPDF\":false,\"YEAR\":1992,\"allAuthors\":[\"Morgan,

        who were examined in 1976 and 1981; in 1987, only the men were examined. Blood

        following six monoalkyl esters of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
        were synthesized and evaluated for relative activities in mobilizing lead
        from kidneys and brains of lead-bearing mice: n-propyl (Mn-PDMS), i-propyl
        (Mi-PDMS), n-butyl (Mn-BDMS), i-butyl (Mi-BDMS), n-amyl (Mn-ADMS) and i-amyl
        meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate (Mi-ADMS). DMSA was used as a positive control.
        When each was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) as a single dose of 2.0
        mmol/kg, DMSA lowered the kidney lead concentration 52%, while the monoesters
        effected reductions of 54-75%. Mn-ADMS was toxic at this dose. DMSA lowered
        the brain lead level 20% when given as a single dose, while the monoesters
        conferred reductions of 64-87%. When given as 5 daily i.p. injections at 0.5
        mmol/kg, DMSA reduced the kidney lead concentration 45%, while the monoesters
        caused reductions of 56-73%. DMSA lowered the brain lead concentration 35%
        on the 5-day treatment regimen, while the monoesters evoked reductions of
        59-75%. Mi-ADMS was equally effective when given orally or i.p. The i.p. LD50

        variation in susceptibility to chemical toxicity may be due to differences
        in toxicokinetic patterns or effect modification. Well-documented interspecies
        genetic differences in susceptibility to chemicals had lead to studies of
        such variation also within species. Epidemiological evidence now suggests
        that common variations, particularly in the P-450 enzymes, may play a major
        role in determining individual susceptibility to chemically-induced disease.
        Physiologic factors are involved in the particular susceptibility of the fetus,
        the newborn, and the old. Constitutional susceptibility is also affected by
        acquired conditions, including chronic disease, such as diabetes mellitus.
        Perhaps the most complex area relates to the increase in vulnerability caused
        by previous or contemporary exposure to other factors, thus eliciting, e.g.,
        synergistic effects. Although amply demonstrated by experimental studies,
        epidemiological or clinical confirmation is generally lacking. One hypothesis
        suggests that a chemical exposure may affect the reserve capacity of the body,
        though not resulting in any immediate adverse effect. Subsequently, the body
        becomes unable to compensate for an additional stress, and toxicity then develops.
        Epidemiological approaches are available and need to be expanded. Research
        in this area has potential ethical implications which should be dealt with
        in an open, informed forum.\",\"url\":\"https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/50044\",\"hasPDF\":false,\"YEAR\":1992,\"allAuthors\":[\"Grandjean,

        were induced in eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) by a mixture of aromatic
        hydrocarbons, an aromatic amine, polychlorinated biphenyls, chlorinated hydrocarbons,
        a nitrosoamine and heavy metals. Kidney and enteric tumors developed in oysters
        following exposure to a mixture containing 3,4-benzopyrene, 1,2-benzanthracene,
        2-aminofluorene, N-nitrosodiethylamine, technical chlordane, Aroclors 1242
        and 1254, p,p'-DDE, cadmium (CdCl2), chromium (K2CrO4) and lead (Pb(NO3)2).
        The chemical concentrations added to a reference sediment from Long Island
        Sound were 1 x and 10 x the measured level in sediment from Black Rock Harbor
        (BRH), Bridgeport, Connecticut (normalized for total organic carbon and acid
        volatile sulfide content for organic and inorganic compounds, respectively).
        2-Aminoflourene and N-nitrosodiethylamine, not measured in BRH sediment, were
        both added at 0.6 and 6.0 mug/g dry sediment. A 3% prevalence of low-grade
        renal and gastrointestinal tumors developed after 30 days in oysters fed water-column
        suspended sediment particulate spiked with the mixture of chemicals. Disease
        progression was most advanced in enteric adenomas. Both types are comparable
        to those produced after 30 days in the same organs by chemically contaminated
        Black Rock Harbor sediment. The action of chemical pollutants reported here
        represents initial findings in a series of studies designed to test sediment
        contaminants as causal factors for tumors in oysters.\",\"url\":\"https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/50011\",\"hasPDF\":true,\"YEAR\":1992,\"allAuthors\":[\"Gardner,

        female rhesus monkeys were fed diets containing 0, 5, or 25 ppt 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin

        TCDD exposure (Experiment 1) and again after TCDD exposure ended (Experiment
        2). Offspring from both experiments were weaned at 4 months and socialized
        for 1.5 h/day in groups of four monkeys each beginning at approximately 8
        months of age. Each social group contained both control and TCDD-exposed monkeys.
        In Experiment 2, the offspring were later placed in new social groups containing
        only monkeys from the same TCDD exposure condition. The TCDD-exposed offspring
        born concurrent with maternal TCDD exposure (Experiment 1) initiated more
        rough-tumble play, retreated less during play bouts, and were less often displaced
        from preferred positions in the playroom. They also engaged in more self-directed
        behaviors. The behavior of offspring born after maternal TCDD exposure ended
        (Experiment 2) was not altered when they were socialized with control monkeys.
        However, some behavioral changes did emerge when they were placed in social

        is estimated as the product of the concentration in the relevant medium, a
        medium-specific contact rate, and an empirically determined ratio between
        intake and blood level. The inhalation pathway omits the contact rate and
        uses a ratio between the concentration in blood and the concentration in air.

        examine the impact of lead (Pb) exposure during the ontogeny of dopaminergic
        (DA) systems on resultant DA function, rats were exposed postnatally (0\u201321
        days of age) via the lactating dam to 0, 100 or 350 ppm Pb acetate in drinking
        water. At 2 months of age, the postnatally Pb-exposed rats were trained to
        discriminate the stimulus properties of either the D1 receptor agonist SKF38393
        (6.0 mg/kg) or the D2-D3 receptor family subtype agonist quinpirole (0.05
        mg/kg) from saline using a standard two-lever operant food-reinforced drug
        discrimination paradigm. In each training group, dose-effect curves describing
        drug lever responding to lower doses of the training drug and to preadministration
        of selective DA antagonists were obtained to examine Pb-induced changes in
        DA sensitivity. Doses of other DA agonists were substituted for the training
        drug to determine the generality of any changes in DA sensitivity, and doses
        of non-DA compounds were substituted to determine the specificity of any changes
        in DA sensitivity. In the D1/saline training condition, Pb exposure was not
        associated with any specific or consistent changes in DA sensitivity. In contrast,
        exposure to Pb was associated with D2-D3 receptor subtype supersensitivity
        as was indicated by significantly elevated levels of drug lever responding
        in the presence of quinpirole and haloperidol and to at least one dose of
        apomorphine. No differences in the dose-effect curves for either (+)-amphetamine
        or NMDA were observed in the D2-D3-trained control and Pb-exposed groups,
        but an increase in drug lever responding in the presence of pentobarbital
        was noted in the Pb-exposed group relative to control. Taken together, these
        findings are consistent with a Pb-induced functional D2-D3 supersensitivity
        possibly mediated via autoreceptors. Moreover, this functional D2-D3 supersensitivity
        necessarily represents a permanent effect of postnatal Pb exposure since both
        blood and brain Pb levels were negligible at the time drug discrimination
        training began.\",\"url\":\"https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/50038\",\"hasPDF\":true,\"YEAR\":1992,\"allAuthors\":[\"Cory-Slechta,

        to lead (Pb) continues to be a source of concern for the U.S. Food and Drug
        Administration and other federal regulatory agencies. Blood lead levels as
        low as 10 micrograms Pb/dl have been associated with impaired neurobehavioral
        development in children and infants. Because of exposure to the fetus, blood
        lead levels of 10 micrograms Pb/dl are also of concern in pregnant women.
        Blood lead levels of 30 micrograms Pb/dl have been associated with elevated
        blood pressure and other adverse effects in adults. The dietary exposure that
        results in these blood levels of concern were estimated to be 60 micrograms
        Pb/day for children age 6 years or younger, 150 micrograms Pb/day for children
        age 7 years or older, 250 micrograms Pb/day for pregnant women, and 750 micrograms

        principal environmental health issue for American children is pervasive lead
        poisoning from the many decades of lead contamination. Available scientific
        evidence cementing lead's premiere ranking is voluminous, multifaceted, and
        compelling. This evidence, however, requires organization into a clear and
        coherent body of science before it can be fully recognized or comprehended
        by either the scientific community or the general public and its representatives:
        public health officials, regulators, policy makers, and legislators. An attempt
        at such organization is presented and begins with the premise that there exist
        clear, objective criteria by which a premiere environmental health issue can
        be defined. A second premise is that these criteria sort themselves into three
        categories which cover the full spectrum of toxic contaminant-population relationships.
        They are: (1) economic and sociopolitical, (2) scientific and public health,
        and (3) societal risk assessment criteria. The first set of criteria includes
        economic and historical centrality, primacy of economic over public health
        considerations, a relatively narrow decision-making framework, and controlled
        flow of information on the toxicant, especially its negative impacts. The
        second set of criteria is also orthodox in scope: the toxicant should be indestructible,
        should accumulate in both the environment and the body, and should be a multimedia
        contaminant; it should produce toxicity in numerous organs with little impediment;
        toxicity should be produced with low/no threshold in huge numbers of the most
        vulnerable; and finally, effects should persist in the critical target organ(s).
        There is a third, more globally encompassing, set of criteria important for
        present-day requirements for risk assessment; e.g., the contaminant should
        produce full-spectrum population-wide as well as individual toxicity. Evidence
        for societal harm should be compelling. It should typify the increasing importance
        of the elements of preventive over clinical medicine and the substance should
        bring to bear the cost-benefit analysis of macro plus micro health risk. Lead
        exposure and toxicity is conclusively shown to meet ALL of these criteria
        and is the premiere environmental health threat to America's children.\",\"url\":\"https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/50074\",\"hasPDF\":false,\"YEAR\":1992,\"allAuthors\":[\"Mushak,
