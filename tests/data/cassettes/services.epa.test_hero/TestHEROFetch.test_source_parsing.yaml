        our laboratory, chronically feeding cadmium to groups of rats has been reproducibly
        associated with average increases of 15 to 20 mm Hg in systolic pressure.
        A total of 497 female Long-Evans rats were continuously provided with drinking
        water fortified with five essential elements and containing from 0.01 to 50
        ppm cadmium, as the acetate, from weaning for as long as 30 months. These
        rats, plus 311 matched control animals which received fortified water without
        added cadmium, were fed a special low-cadmium diet. All 808 rats were weighed
        at least monthly as a screen for cadmium toxicity, and their systolic pressures
        were measured every 3 or 6 months. The two lowest concentrations of cadmium
        tested (0.01 and 0.03 ppm) were not pressor; the three highest concentrations
        (10, 25, and 50 ppm) ultimately proved to be toxic. All indirect systolic
        pressures (each measured in triplicate) of all rats which received 0.1 to
        5 ppm cadmium (i.e., nontoxic pressor doses) averaged 15.0 mm Hg more than
        simultaneously measured pressures of control rats. This average increase over
        the control pressure is extremely significant statistically, even though it
        seems relatively small in absolute terms. Occasionally, however, some rats
        had much larger than average increases in pressure; thus, 10 of 60 rats receiving
        from 0.1 to 0.5 ppm cadmium for 18 months had systolic pressures that were
        more than 50 mm Hg above the average pressure of the control rats. Cadmium-induced
        hypertension is not limited to females or to a particular strain. Although
        we have usually used one strain of female Long-Evans rat from a single source,
        males of the same strain and female Sprague-Dawley rats have also developed
        comparable hypertension. All subgroup II elements can apparently induce similar
        increases in systolic pressure averaging 15 to 20 mm Hg, but cadmium is pressor
        in much smaller amounts than mercury or zinc. Thus, to induce a demonstrable
        increase in pressure requires more than ten times as much divalent mercuric
        ion as cadmium and more than 1000 times as much zinc as cadmium. Exposure
        to another metal along with cadmium can markedly alter the ability of cadmium
        to induce hypertension. Selenium protects against the hypertension induced
        by twice as much cadmium. Large excesses of both zinc and copper have also
        inhibited the induction of hypertension by cadmium. In contrast, lead, which
        like cadmium, can also induce hypertension, augments rather than inhibits
        cadmium-induced hypertension; thus, lead and cadmium together can induce an
        average increase in systolic pressure in excess of 40 mm Hg, at least twice
        as large as is usually induced by either metal alone.\",\"url\":\"https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/54501\",\"hasPDF\":true,\"YEAR\":1979,\"allAuthors\":[\"Perry,
