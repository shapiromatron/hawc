        \ changes in early asbestosis, three groups of sheep were repeatedly exposed\
        \ to intratracheal instillations of either saline (controls), low doses of\
        \ UICC chrysotile asbestos (LD), or high doses of the fibers (HD) until an\
        \ alveolitis was observed in all HD sheep during the twelfth month of exposure.\
        \ All sheep were studied bimonthly by transbronchial lung biopsy (LB), bronchoalveolar\
        \ lavage (BAL), pulmonary function tests (PFT), and chest roentgenograms (CXR).\
        \ While LBs of the HD sheep demonstrated large accumulations of monocyte-macrophages\
        \ in the alveolar and interstitial spaces, those of controls and LD sheep\
        \ did not. In BAL, there was no difference in total and differential cell\
        \ counts between groups, but the BAL lymphocyte proliferative capacity was\
        \ clearly depressed in all asbestos-exposed sheep. In the BAL supernatant,\
        \ total proteins (mainly albumin, beta + gamma globulins) and lactate dehydrogenase\
        \ were significantly elevated in the HD group only. This alveolitis was associated\
        \ with a fall in vital capacity, lung compliance, diffusing capacity, and\
        \ arterial PO2. Abnormalities on CXR appeared 3 months later. Thus, the cellular\
        \ and biochemical features of early asbestosis are clearly distinct from those\

        BIOL ABS.  Acrylonitrile (AN) is a rat carcinogen. Human exposure may come
        from chemical industries and smoking. A haemoglobin adduct of acrylonitrile
        (Hb-AN) has been used as a biomarker of exposure by means of gas chromatography-mass
        spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. We have developed specific monoclonal antibodies
        (Mab) to human Hb-AN and wish to report evaluation of an immunoassay in rats
        using an Mab that cross-reacts with rat Hb-AN. A dose response study of LD
        0, 10, 50, and 90 in Sprague-Dawley rats  was undertaken, with each rat receiving
        (2,3-14C)AN at 50 muCi kg-1 sc, and Hb from an aliquot of blood was taken
        for covalent binding analysis by liquid scintillation spectrometry and fluorescence
        ELISA. The dose responses of rats at 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 h after AN doses
        of 20, 50, 80, 115 mg kg-1 were compared by both methods with Hb and globin
        samples. Regression analysis showed a linear relationship between immunoassay
        and 14C-AN binding. This indicates that an antigenic for","url":"https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/1010101","hasPDF":false,"YEAR":1998,"allAuthors":["Wong,

        project ''Accumulation of environmental risks'' was aimed at developing methods
        to illustrate the geographical differences in risks to human health due to
        several types of environmental pollution. The following risks were considered:
        possible major accidents, radioactive substances and radiation, several carcinogenic
        substances in air and environmental noise, with the methods used based on
        the risk concept implemented in the Netherlands environmental policy. Starting
        with information on  sources and emissions of several contaminants, their
        dispersion in air and human exposure to them were calculated, and the effects
        on human health estimated. The results were presented in a number of national
        maps. In spite of the complexity of discussions on risk-related subjects,
        applying the methods developed during the project has been shown to lead to
