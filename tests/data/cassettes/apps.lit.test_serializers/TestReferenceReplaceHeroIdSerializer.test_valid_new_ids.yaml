        (AN) is a rat carcinogen. Human exposure may come from chemical industries
        and smoking. A haemoglobin adduct of acrylonitrile (Hb-AN) has been used as
        a biomarker of exposure by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
        analysis. We have developed specific monoclonal antibodies (Mab) to human
        Hb-AN and wish to report evaluation of an immunoassay in rats using an Mab
        that cross-reacts with rat Hb-AN. A dose response study of LD 0, 10, 50, and
        90 in Sprague-Dawley rats was undertaken, with each rat receiving \[2,3-14C]AN
        at 50 Ci kg-1 sc, and Hb from an aliquot of blood was taken for covalent binding
        analysis by liquid scintillation spectrometry and fluorescence ELISA. The
        dose responses of rats at 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 h after AN doses of 20,
        50, 80, 115 mg kg-1 were compared by both methods with Hb and globin samples.
        Regression analysis showed a linear relationship between immunoassay and 14C-AN
        binding. This indicates that an antigenic form of Hb-AN may be used as a surrogate
        of Hb-AN adduct. The sensitivity of ELISA was tested in rats exposed for 1
        h to sub-toxic doses of AN (10-1.1 mg kg-1). Quantification of Hb-AN by immunoassay
        was achieved by calibration with a synthetic adduct HbAN4h, a reference adduct
        prepared by treating rat Hb with excess AN for 4 h. ELISA and GC-MS analysis
        of N-terminal valine-AN in the Hb-AN adduct were compared and similar detection
        levels were found. This rat study appears to have validated the new immunoassay
        method for biomonitoring of AN exposure.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList
