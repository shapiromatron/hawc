    "Abstract": "Consuming small-sized fish species whole, and bones of large fish could contribute significantly to reducing the level of micronutrient and protein malnutrition. These fish products are more affordable and could therefore meet the needs of poor, vulnerable groups, particularly in rural and urban areas where limited economic resources prevent dietary diversity. The objectives of the study were to produce fish powder from dried edible byproducts from fish processing factories, an underutilized fish species, burrito and to determine the physical, micromineral, macronutrient and microbiological quality of the dried fish powder. Edible fish processing byproducts and an underutilized fish, burrito (Brachydeuterus auritus) were cleaned thoroughly and dried with a Council for Scientific and Industrial Research-Food Research Institute (CSIR-FRI) gas-fuelled oven at 55\u00b0C for 8\u00a0h or until dried. The dried products were milled into powder, and packaged into polythene bags. Proximate analysis of the fish powder was done Official Methods of Analysis (AOAC) methods. Minerals and heavy metals in the fish powder were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). Microbiological quality was determined by Nordic Committee on Food Analysis Method (NMLK) methods. Tuna trimmings contained 80.71\u00a0g/100\u00a0g protein, whereas burrito contained 70.40\u00a0g/100\u00a0g protein. Concentrations of cadmium, arsenic, and mercury varied from <1.00 to 1\u00a0mg/kg. Lead was found at 0.04\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g in tuna frames and gills only. All fish byproducts contained high levels of iron, for example, trimmings contained 16.58\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g, whereas tuna frames and gills also contained 16.82 and 19.54\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g, respectively. Burrito contained 8.92\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g. Zinc levels also ranged from 0.41\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g in tuna trimmings to 1.88\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g in tuna gills. The powdered samples according to the standards set by Ghana Standard Authority, were acceptable. Consuming small- sized fish species whole, and bones of large fish could contribute significantly to reducing the level of micronutrient and protein malnutrition. These are more affordable and could therefore meet the needs of poor, vulnerable groups.",

    "Abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Aloysia polystachya (Griseb) Moldenke (Verbenaceae), popularly known as \"burrito\", is a South American species widely prescribed by local Brazilian healers for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, its antihypertensive and cardioprotective effects are still unknown.AIM: To evaluate the role of the ethanol-soluble fraction of A. polystachya leaves (ESAP) against hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), as well as its safety, morphoanatomical and phytochemical aspects.MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, the leaves and stems of A. polystachya were analyzed by optical and scanning electron microscopy in order to provide anatomical data for quality control. Then, ESAP was obtained and its chemical profile was analyzed by LC-DAD-MS. In addition, the cytotoxic and acute toxicity potential of ESAP were evaluated in six cell lines and in female Wistar rats, respectively. Next, female spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) received ESAP (30, 100, 300\u00a0mg/kg), hydrochlorothiazide (25\u00a0mg/kg), or vehicle once daily for 28 days. Weekly kidney function was monitored by analyzing urinary parameters. At the end of the 28-day treatment, the electrocardiographic profile, blood pressure, and renal and mesenteric vascular reactivity were evaluated. Relative organ (heart, kidney, and liver) weights and biochemical parameters were also evaluated. Finally, the heart, kidneys, and aorta were collected for determination of the tissue redox state, cardiac morphometry, and histopathological analysis.RESULTS: The chemical profile of ESAP was composed by organic acids, a nucleoside, methoxylated flavones and glycosylated compounds including phenolic acids, phenylpropanoids, iridoids and monoterpenes. No signs of toxicity were observed in all cell's lines nor in female Wistar rats submitted to this trial. All SHRs from the negative control group presented a reduction in renal function, alterations in the renal and mesenteric vascular reactivity, and electrocardiographic and morphometric changes typical of ventricular hypertrophy. Oral prolonged ESAP-administration in SHRs was able to reverse renal, electrocardiographic and hemodynamic changes induced by hypertension. Moreover, ESAP-treatment was able to modulate the vascular and renal arterial reactivity and tissue redox state. The aforementioned data were accompanied by reduction of cardiac hypertrophy.CONCLUSION: In this study, we present important anatomical and phytochemical data that contributed to the correct identification and quality control of A. polystachya. In addition, we have shown that ESAP is safe after acute administration and present significant cardioprotective effects (at 30, 100, and 300\u00a0mg/kg doses) in SHRs after prolonged treatment.",
