    "Abstract": "The investigation describes the follow-up of the victims of the 1995 Tokyo sarin attack who were followed by a team at the St. Luke's International Hospital. A symptom questionnaire (\"St. Luke's Questionnaire\") was developed and given 2, 3, and 5 years following the sarin attack. Somatic and psychological symptoms have continued for 5 years after the incident. New post-traumatic stress disorder diagnostic criteria, which include physical symptoms, were developed and applied for assessment of the outcomes. The St. Luke's cohort was also compared with other Japanese sarin attack cohorts. Interventions, including counseling, medical treatments, and support group activities, were associated with fewer symptoms among the victims.",

    "Abstract": "The present study investigated the effects of the known xenoestrogen bisphenol A (BPA) relative to eight BPA-related diphenylalkanes on estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated vitellogenin (vtg) production in hepatocytes from male carp (Cyprinus carpio), and on aromatase (CYP19) activity in the human adrenocortical H295R carcinoma cell line. Of the eight diphenylalkanes, only 4,4'-(hexafluoropropylidene)diphenol (BHF) and 2,2'-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methylphenyl)propane (BPRO) induced vtg, i.e., to a maximum of 3% to 4% (at 100 microM) compared with 8% for BPA relative to the maximum induction by 17beta-estradiol (E2, 1 microM). Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) was a potent antagonist of vtg production with an IC50 of 5.5 microM, virtually 100% inhibition of vtg at 20 microM, and an inhibitive (IC50) potency about one-tenth that of the known ER antagonist tamoxifen (IC50, 0.6 microM). 2,2'-Diallyl bisphenol A, 4,4'-(1,4-phenylene-diisopropylidene)bisphenol, BPRO, and BHF were much less inhibitory with IC50 concentrations of 20-70 microM, and relative potencies of 0.03 and 0.009 with tamoxifen. Bisphenol ethoxylate showed no anti-estrogenicity (up to 100 microM), and 4,4'-isopropylidene-diphenol diacetate was only antagonistic at 100 microM. When comparing the (anti)estrogenic potencies of these bisphenol A analogues/diphenylalkanes, anti-estrogenicity occurred at lower concentrations than estrogenicity. 4,4'-Isopropylidenebis(2,6-dimethylphenol) (IC50, 2.0 microM) reduced E2-induced (EC50, 100 nM) vtg production due to concentration-dependent cytotoxicity as indicated by a parallel decrease in MTT activity and vtg, whereas the remaining diphenylalkanes did not cause any cytotoxicity relative to controls. None of the diphenylalkanes (up to 100 microM) induced EROD activity indicating that concentration-dependent, CYP1A enzyme-mediated metabolism of E2, or any Ah-receptor-mediated interaction with the ER, was not a likely explanation for the observed anti-estrogenic effects. At concentrations as great as 100 microM, none of the diphenylalkanes directly inhibited aromatase (CYP19) activity in H295R cells. Environmental exposure of fish to BPA and related diphenylalkanes, depending on the structure, may pose anti-estrogenic, and to a lesser extent estrogenic, risks to development and reproduction.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Decabromodiphenyl ether (DecaBDE; CASRN 1163-19-5) is a flame retardant used in a variety of manufactured products. A single oral dose of 20.1 mg/kg administered to mice on postnatal day 3 has been reported to alter motor activity at 2, 4, and 6 months of age.METHODS: To further evaluate these results, a developmental neurotoxicity study was conducted in the most commonly used species for studies of this type, the rat, according to international validated testing guidelines and Good Laboratory Practice Standards. DecaBDE was administered orally via gavage in corn oil to dams from gestation day 6 to weaning at doses of 0, 1, 10, 100, or 1,000 mg/kg/day. Standard measures of growth, development, and neurological endpoints were evaluated in the offspring. Motor activity was assessed at 2 months of age. Additional motor activity assessments were conducted at 4 and 6 months of age. Neuropathology and morphometry evaluations of the offspring were performed at weaning and adulthood.RESULTS: No treatment-related neurobehavioral changes were observed in detailed clinical observations, startle response, or learning and memory tests. No test substance-related changes were noted in motor activity assessments performed at 2, 4, or 6 months of age. Finally, no treatment-related neuropathological or morphometric alterations were found.CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this study, the no-observed-adverse-effect level for developmental neurotoxicity of DecaBDE was 1,000 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Childhood asthma has become a critical public health problem because of its high morbidity and increasing prevalence. The impact of nutrition and other exposures during pregnancy on long-term health and development of children has been of increasing interest.OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association of folate and folic acid intake during pregnancy and risk of asthma and other allergic outcomes in children.DESIGN: We performed a systematic search of 8 electronic databases for articles that examined the association between prenatal folate or folic acid exposure and risk of asthma and other allergic outcomes (eg, allergy, eczema, and atopic dermatitis) in childhood. We performed a meta-analysis by using a random-effects model to derive a summary risk estimate of studies with similar exposure timing, exposure assessment, and outcomes.RESULTS: Our meta-analysis provided no evidence of an association between maternal folic acid supplement use (compared with no use) in the prepregnancy period through the first trimester and asthma in childhood (summary risk estimate: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.30). Because of substantial heterogeneity in exposures and outcomes, it was not possible to generate summary measures for other folate indicators (eg, blood folate concentrations) and asthma or allergy-related outcomes; however, the preponderance of primary risk estimates was not elevated.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support an association between periconceptional folic acid supplementation and increased risk of asthma in children. However, because of the limited number and types of studies in the literature, additional research is needed.",
