Examples include: failing to control for litter effects (e.g., when presenting pup data rather than the preferred litter data); pooling results from males and females or across lesion types; failing to address observed or presumed toxicity (e.g., in assessed animals; in dams) when exposure levels are known or expected to be highly toxic; incomplete presentation of the data (e.g., presenting continuous data as dichotomized); or non-preferred display of results (e.g., using a different readout than is expected for that assay). The evaluator should support how or why, and to what extent, this might mislead interpretations.</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: Concerns regarding the statistical methods applied are not addressed during study evaluation, but should be flagged for review by the SWG.
